    <h3>什么时候会产生这个错误？</h3>
</p>
<p>
    当发现<strong>一个未被括号包含的、立即调用的函数</strong>时，JSLint会抛出这个"Wrap an immediate function invocation in parentheses"错误。在某些情况下JSHint会抛出这个错误，但是只有<strong>设置了 <span class="code">immed</span> 选项为<span class="code">true</span>时</strong>。在下面这个例子中我们将匿名函数<em>返回值</em>赋给了变量<span class="code">x</span>:
</p>
<textarea>
/*jshint immed: true */
var x = function () {
    "use strict";
    return {
        y: 1
    };
}();</textarea>

    <h3>为什么会产生这个错误？</h3>
</p>
<p>
    This error is raised to highlight a <strong>lack of convention</strong>. Your code will run fine if you do not fix this error, but it may be confusing to others.
</p>
<p>
    Since function statements cannot be immediately invoked, and function <em>expressions</em> can be, a common technique to create an immediately-invoked function expression is to simply wrap a function statement in parentheses. The opening parentheses causes the contained function to be parsed as an expression, rather than a declaration:
</p>
<textarea>
var x;
(function () {
    "use strict";
    x = 10;
}());</textarea>
<p>
    If you remove the wrapping parentheses from the above example, you will end up with a syntax error. For that reason, when immediately invoking a function expression that doesn't require any special treatment to turn it into an expression (as in the first example above), convention dictates that you should wrap it in parentheses anyway, for consistency and to make it clearer that the resulting value of the overall expression is the <em>return value</em> of the function, rather than a reference to the function itself:
</p>
<textarea>
var x = (function () {
    "use strict";
    return {
        y: 1
    };
}());</textarea>
<p>
    Note that by fixing this error you are likely to end up with the related "<a href="../move-the-invocation-into-the-parens-that-contain-the-function/">Move the invocation into the parens that contain the function</a>" error, which should be very simple to fix at this point.

    <h3>Edge cases</h3>
</p>
<p>
    In some situations, both JSLint and JSHint will incorrectly raise a single warning when they should be raising 2. In the following example, the value of <span class="code">x</span> will be the result of the logical and operation on the return value of the two immediately-invoked function expressions. If the parentheses wrapping the entire expression are removed, two warnings are issues instead of one:
</p>
<textarea>
/*jshint immed: true */
var x = (function () {
    "use strict";
    return true;
}() && function () {
    "use strict";
    return false;
}());</textarea>
<p class="standout">
    In JSHint 1.0.0 and above you have the ability to ignore any warning with a <a href="http://jshint.com/docs/#options" target="_blank">special option syntax</a>. The identifier of this warning is <strong>W062</strong>. This means you can tell JSHint to not issue this warning with the <code>/*jshint -W062 */</code> directive.
